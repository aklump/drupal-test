It provides Unit, Kernel, and Client abstract test classes to use in writing your tests, a single test runner, testing for modules and themes, support for JsonSchema validation, as well as a set of guidelines and processes for better testing of Drupal 7 modules and websites.  All of this using a single test runner that can be divided by test suite or filtered by test class using normal PhpUnit options.  Finally, manual functional tests are supported as well.  Visit https:\/\/aklump.github.io\/drupal-test for full documentation.  Quick Start  After installation (see below), follow instructions in the documentation (docs\/index.html) to write and run tests.  Requirements   Composer PHPUnit   Contributing  If you find this project useful... please consider making a donation.  Installation  From inside the directory above the web root run this one-liner:  [ ! -d tests ] &amp;&amp; git clone https:\/\/github.com\/aklump\/drupal-test.git tests &amp;&amp; (cd tests &amp;&amp; .\/bin\/install.sh) || echo \"Installation error, nothing installed.\"   About the files in this project  The following files are considered core and should never be modified.  drupal_test.yml drupal_test_bootstrap.php LICENSE README.md   Additionally, do not add files to the following folders, which are replaced on every update.  It is safe to add classes to src so long as you avoid src\/DrupalTest.  docs src\/DrupalTest   Do not modify any of the files in bin, which are provided by this module.  You may add your own files to bin, if you wish.  Update to the latest version  From inside the tests directory, run:  .\/bin\/update.sh   This will copy over the core files from the latest repository, but leave the non-core files alone, namely phpunit.xml and composer.json, which you most-likely will have modified.  Configuration  See documentation for more information about configuration.   Open tests\/composer.json and add module and theme composer.json filepaths. From tests run composer update --lock. Open tests\/phpunit.xml and add any JSON schema directories.

","tags":"","url":"README.html"},{"title":"Client Tests","text":"  Client tests use Mink for the most part, sometimes just Guzzle.  These tests are headless.  If you need a full browser, take a look at End to End.  This is a type of tests where you will be testing endpoints of an API or URLs.  Use this to check for URL statuses and headers for example.  This has the same scope as unit tests, which means you can access class constants, but no Drupal bootstrap.  Tests act as an API consumer or client of the website.  There are custom assert methods on this class to help with such testing.  These types can test for:   Redirects Page contents HTTP status codes REST responses   Configuration  The base URL must be set in an environment variable in order for client tests to work, e.g.,  $ cd tests\/phpunit $ export TEST_BASE_URL=http:\/\/my-website.loft; phpunit -c phpunit.xml --testsuite Client   If the site under test is behind http authorization you must also provide that, e.g.  $ export TEST_BASE_URL=http:\/\/user:pass@my-website.loft; phpunit -c phpunit.xml --testsuite Client   Cookies   By default a single cookie jar is shared across all client tests. To reset the cookie jar for a given class use static::emptyCookieJar(); inside of ::setUp() on your test class. To reset the cookie jar for a given test use static::emptyCookieJar(); inside the test method.   Assertions  In addition to the usual assertions, you will find some new assert* methods on the class, see the code for more information.  Also be aware that you have access to all of Mink's WebAssert methods when you use assert().  See examples to follow.  Assert Page Content  Using a string search:  $this-&gt;loadPageByUrl('\/collections')   -&gt;assert()-&gt;responseContains('logo.jpg')  $this-&gt;loadPageByUrl('\/collections')   -&gt;assert()-&gt;pageTextContains('Welcome home!')

You indicate where your schema files are located in phpunit.xml using the custom key jsonschema.  Child nodes of directory are relative to phpunit.xml; you may use globs; you may have more than one directory node.  &lt;phpunit&gt;     &lt;jsonschema&gt;         &lt;directory&gt;..\/web\/sites\/all\/modules\/custom\/*\/tests\/schema&lt;\/directory&gt;     &lt;\/jsonschema&gt; &lt;\/phpunit&gt;   Then to validate an URL do something like the following:  Validating XML Responses  This example shows how load an endpoint that returns XML and validate that using a JSON Schema; then it checks for specific values in the XML.  public function testXMLEndpoint() {   $this-&gt;loadXmlByUrl('api\/1\/some\/endpoint')     -&gt;assertResponseMatchesSchema('resource.json');    $this-&gt;assertSame(123, (int) $this-&gt;xml-&gt;id);   $this-&gt;assertSame('name', (string) $this-&gt;xml-&gt;name); }    ","tags":"","url":"client.html"},{"title":"Destructive Tests","text":"  Use \\AKlump\\DrupalTest\\Utilities\\DestructiveTrait if you want to use a convention whereby certain tests will only be allowed to run against certain base URLs.

The purpose of end to end testing is to simulate the real user scenario and validate the system under test and its components for integration and data integrity.   Create these tests by extending \\AKlump\\DrupalTest\\EndToEndTestBase.  They should be saved in your Client folders.  These tests are the slowest as they offer a full browser environment, so they facilitate the testing of forms, multi-page workflows, and Javascript interaction.  If you just want to check for elements on a single page, use \\AKlump\\DrupalTest\\ClientTestBase instead.  These tests use Mink and Selenium to have a fully controllable browser, but run against a real site in it's active state.  These should be used when you wish to interact at the Browser level with a website in it's current state, just as you would as a human running manual tests.     These are not the same as Drupal 8's Browser Tests because: \"Browser tests create a complete Drupal installation and a virtual web browser and then use the virtual web browser to walk the Drupal install through a series of tests, just like you would do if you were doing it by hand.\"      These tests DO NOT create a complete Drupal installation.   Installation   You must have a running selenium server to use these tests.   Installing Selenium Standalone Server  This should be as simple as downloading a file, and starting a Java process on that file.  Follow these steps:   Download from this page; the link should be at the top.  This needs to happen just once.  Place it in a logical location on your system, maybe your home folder. Create a shortcut script .\/bin\/selenium.sh to launch your Selenium server with contents like this, adjusted for your situation.  #!\/usr\/bin\/env bash java -jar \/Users\/aklump\/selenium\/selenium-server-standalone-3.141.59.jar  -host 127.0.0.1 -port 4444  Make that script executable chmod u+x .\/bin\/selenium.sh Start your server in a new terminal window:  cd {path to this lib} .\/bin\/selenium.sh  Verify it's running by visiting: http:\/\/127.0.0.1:4444\/wd\/hub\/static\/resource\/hub.html   Organizing Tests   Think of a single test class as one end-to-end scenario. Have lots of shorter test classes. Break each scenario (class) into small units, as test methods. Keep test methods small and named very discriptively.   Annotations   Give the test class a summary such as User is able to login... If the test modifies the database in any way mark the class @destructive. Make test method names very descriptive so they can be parsed: testLoggedInUserCanAccessUserSettingsPage  &lt;?php  namespace Drupal\\Tests\\gop;  \/**   User is able to login, change password, logout and login with new password.  @destructive *\/ class UserCanChangePasswordEndToEndTest extends EndToEndTestBase {  public function testLoggedInUserCanAccessUserSettingsPage() { ...    #  Using Mink's WebAssert   All of the methods of \\Behat\\Mink\\WebAssert are available in your test methods through the use of ::assert(), e.g.  public function testPageTextOnHomepage() {   $this-&gt;loadPageByUrl('\/');    \/\/ This is a method from \\Behat\\Mink\\WebAssert that has been made available by \\AKlump\\DrupalTest\\EndToEndTestBase   $this-&gt;assert()-&gt;pageTextContains('Welcome to My Website'); }  ::assert() returns you a wrapper around \\Behat\\Mink\\WebAssert that handles assertion tallies and failure exceptions normally throw by \\Behat\\Mink\\WebAssert in a way native to PhpUnit. There is some duplication with certain shorthand and common assertions, for example take these two examples of the same assertion.  The first one has an opinion that all elements should be searched using a CSS selector, so there's less typing, however the second is more powerful, and in fact necessary if you want to assert using XPath.  $this-&gt;assertElementExists('.t-trigger-account-dropdown'); $this-&gt;assert()-&gt;elementExists('css', '.t-trigger-account-dropdown');    An Example End To End Test   Notice we load the page using relative links.  $this-&gt;loadPageByUrl('\/');  Then we get the elements by CSS selectors, which we'll need to work the test.  Notice the latter two begin with .t-.  To keep tests as flexible as possible I prefer to add test only classes directly to elements, using these over any other kind of identification (class, id, XPath, etc).  These test classes will only be rendered during testing.  ::getDomElements requires there is only one DOM node with each given class.  $el = $this-&gt;getDomElements([   '.search-widget',   '.page-header__search a',   '.t-text-search__input',   '.t-text-search__submit', ]);  If all elements are located in the DOM then you will be able to work with them as in the example; if not the test will fail.  Each element is a Node Element, with all the corresponding methods.  $el['.search-widget']-&gt;isVisible()  Notice the messages passed to the assertions.  These should be an affirmative statement describing the correct result.  You should include these as assert arguments, rather than as code comments in order to make your tests more readable.  $this-&gt;assertFalse(   $el['.search-widget']-&gt;isVisible(),   \"The search modal is hidden by default.\" );  The use of waitFor is only necessary if you have to wait for some JS to execute, or to wait for an AJAX load. Lastly notice the use of ::readPage, it must be called because the session has changed pages, and we want to make assertions on the newest page.

Quick Start   When you see tests\/composer.json, we are referring the file included in the dist folder of this project, which is the root directory containing the test runner phpunit.xml. Create composer.json in the module's folder ensuring it will autoload the module's classes that will be tested.  If not testing classes, but functions, make sure the module's composer.json file loads all files that contain the functions to be tested, usually using requre-dev.  This file may or may not have anything to do with Drupal (depending on the module's implementation), but it is required by the test runner's unit testing strategy. Add the path to the test runner's composer.json to tests\/composer.json, and you must call composer update --lock on the test runner for dependencies to be installed for the test runner. Add one or more tests to the module (according the file structure convention) extending one of the abstract classes provided by this module, e.g. \\AKlump\\DrupalTest\\UnitTestBase, `   Test File Structure  Each module or theme provides tests and schema files relative to it's own directory (.).

This is how the unit tests are able to autoload classes without bootstrapping Drupal, e.g.,      \"extra\": {         \"merge-plugin\": {             \"require\": [                 \"..\/web\/sites\/all\/modules\/custom\/gop3_core\/composer.json\"             ]         }     }   Must Test Classes Test a Single Class?  Unit and Kernel tests do not have to test a single class, for example if you are writing a test to cover theme functions.

A Note About Test Suite Order in XML  You will probably not need to modify phpunit.xml. But if you do...  Be very careful when modifying phpunit.xml, that you do not list even a single kernel test before any unit tests.  When any kernel test is run, Drupal will be bootstrapped which \"pollutes\" the global namespace with stuff that could bleed into your unit tests, giving them out-of-scope and misleading functions, classes, constants, etc.  In effect they could be acting like kernel tests, if you're not careful.
