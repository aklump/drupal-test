It provides Unit, Kernel, and Client abstract test classes to use in writing your tests, a single test runner, testing for modules and themes, as well as a set of guidelines and processes for better testing of Drupal 7 modules and websites.

","tags":"","url":"README.html"},{"title":"Client Tests","text":"  This is a type of tests where you will be testing endpoints of an API or URLs.  Use this to check for URL statuses and headers for example.  This has the same scope as unit tests, which means you can access class constants, but no Drupal bootstrap.  Tests act as a API consumer or client of the website.  There are custom assert methods on this class to help with such testing.  \/**  * Assert confirmation page is forbidden.  *\/ public function testConfirmationPageIsForbidden() {   $this-&gt;assertLocalUrlStatus(403, implode('\/', [     'node',     EarthriseService::NID_FORM,     'done',   ])); }   Configuration  The base URL must be set in an environment variable in order for client tests to work, e.g.,  $ cd tests\/phpunit $ export CLIENT_TEST_BASE_URL=http:\/\/develop.globalonenessproject.loft; phpunit -c phpunit.xml --testsuite Client   JSON Schema  The client tests provide the means of validation using JSON Schema.  You indicate where your schema files are located in phpunit.xml using the custom key jsonschema, e.g.,  &lt;phpunit&gt;     &lt;jsonschema&gt;         &lt;directory&gt;..\/web\/sites\/all\/modules\/custom\/my_module\/tests\/schema&lt;\/directory&gt;     &lt;\/jsonschema&gt; &lt;\/phpunit&gt;  ","tags":"","url":"client.html"},{"title":"Kernel Tests","text":"   Test classnames should follow: &#42;KernelTest Kernel tests have a full Drupal bootstrap and access to the database, global functions and constants.

","tags":"","url":"kernel.html"},{"title":"Module and Theme Testing","text":"     In order for unit testing to work with a module or a theme, you must add the module or theme's composer.json file to test\/composers.json and run composer install --lock from the test directory.   Quick Start   When you see tests\/composer.json, we are referring the file included in the dist folder of this project, which is the root directory containing the test runner phpunit.xml. Create composer.json in the module's folder ensuring it will autoload the module's classes that will be tested.  If not testing classes, but functions, make sure the module's composer.json file loads all files that contain the functions to be tested, usually using requre-dev.  This file may or may not have anything to do with Drupal (depending on the module's implementation), but it is required by the test runner's unit testing strategy. Add the path to the test runner's composer.json to tests\/composer.json, and you must call composer update --lock on the test runner for dependencies to be installed for the test runner. Add one or more tests to the module (according the file structure convention) extending one of the abstract classes provided by this module, e.g. \\AKlump\\DrupalTest\\UnitTestBase, `   Test File Structure  Each module or theme provides tests and schema files relative to it's own directory (.).  Following this convention allows the test runner to auto-discover these tests.  e.g.,  . \u2514\u2500\u2500 tests     \u251c\u2500\u2500 jsonschema     \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 story_resource.json     \u2514\u2500\u2500 src         \u251c\u2500\u2500 Client         \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 Service         \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 EarthriseServiceClientTest.php         \u251c\u2500\u2500 Kernel         \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 Service         \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 BreakpointServiceKernelTest.php         \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 TransformKernelTest.php         \u251c\u2500\u2500 TestBase.php         \u2514\u2500\u2500 Unit             \u251c\u2500\u2500 Service             \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 EarthriseServiceUnitTest.php             \u2514\u2500\u2500 TransformUnitTest.php   Add the Module's composer.json  For a module to be unit testable it must have a composer.json file, which autoloads it's classes, the path of which must be added to this project's composer.json file, in the section extra.merge-plugin.require.  This is how the unit tests are able to autoload classes without bootstrapping Drupal, e.g.,      \"extra\": {         \"merge-plugin\": {             \"require\": [                 \"..\/web\/sites\/all\/modules\/custom\/gop3_core\/composer.json\"             ]         }     }   Must Test Classes Test a Single Class?  Unit and Kernel tests do not have to test a single class, for example if you are writing a test to cover theme functions.  In order to make this happen you have to do the following in your test class:      class InTheLoftThemeKernelTest extends KernelTestBase {        protected $schema = [          \/\/ By setting this to false, we indicate we are not testing a class.         'classToBeTested' =&gt; FALSE,       ];      ...

You should try to write unit tests whenever possible.  Only move to Kernel tests if unit tests are not appropriate. If a unit test requires a file that is not normally autoloaded, it should be added to the autoload-dev section of the module's composer file.   A Note About Test Suite Order in XML  You will probably not need to modify phpunit.xml. But if you do...  Be very careful when modifying phpunit.xml, that you do not list even a single kernel test before any unit tests.  When any kernel test is run, Drupal will be bootstrapped which \"pollutes\" the global namespace with stuff that could bleed into your unit tests, giving them out-of-scope and misleading functions, classes, constants, etc.  In effect they could be acting like kernel tests, if you're not careful.  Notice how the unit tests come before the kernel tests in the code below; client tests must also precede the Kernerl tests.  &lt;testsuites&gt;     &lt;testsuite name=\"Unit\"&gt;         &lt;directory&gt;..\/..\/web\/sites\/all\/modules\/custom\/*\/tests\/src\/Unit&lt;\/directory&gt;     &lt;\/testsuite&gt;     &lt;testsuite name=\"Client\"&gt;         &lt;directory&gt;..\/..\/web\/sites\/all\/modules\/custom\/*\/tests\/src\/Client&lt;\/directory&gt;     &lt;\/testsuite&gt;     &lt;testsuite name=\"Kernel\"&gt;         &lt;directory&gt;..\/..\/web\/sites\/all\/modules\/custom\/*\/tests\/src\/Kernel&lt;\/directory&gt;     &lt;\/testsuite&gt; &lt;\/testsuites&gt;   To be sure, run the entire unit test suite standalone on occassion, e.g.,  phpunit . --testsuite Unit   Troubleshooting  Fatal error: Class ... not found ...
